# Decentralized Marketplace

## Project Description  
A decentralized marketplace smart contract where users can list items for sale and others can purchase them directly using Ether. The contract securely manages item listings, ownership, and payments without relying on a central authority.

## Project Vision  
To build a trustless, transparent, and censorship-resistant marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling peer-to-peer commerce in a decentralized manner.

## Key Features  
- Users can list items for sale with a name and price in Ether.  
- Buyers can purchase listed items by sending the correct payment to the contract.  
- Automatic Ether transfer to the seller upon successful purchase.  
- Prevents sellers from buying their own items.  
- Emits events for item listings and purchases to enable easy integration with front-end applications.

## Future Scope  
- Add support for ERC-20 token payments.  
- Enable item cancellation and refunds.  
- Introduce user ratings and reviews for sellers and buyers.  
- Add escrow functionality to hold funds until buyer confirms receipt.  
- Create a front-end UI for seamless interaction with the smart contract.
